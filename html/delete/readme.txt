The exampleFraternityDelete.html is just an example interface. 
The php files currently do not have any info for the mysql_connect. When we decide who will host the database we can put in their info.
Each delete form can be broken out onto its unique page and called using an html form. 
Each file just needs to be passed data matching its respective key (as such, these files may need to be updated if/when changes are made to the schema).
